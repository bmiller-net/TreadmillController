# TreadmillController

This project allows a Netduino mini to run a treadmill at approximately 1.6mph using pulse width modulation. Also contains experimental code for increasing/decreasing the speed of the treadmill using push buttons.

The idea for this came about after I was given a treadmill that a friend was no longer using. I was working from home full time, and wanted to incorporate the treadmill into a walking desk. The OEM control panel for the treadmill was too large to conveniently fit anywhere in my workspace, so I removed the control panel and wired the treadmill controller to a Netduino mini using a breadboard.
